# Two_Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 - Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

 - Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

 - Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## Lessons Learned

Persistence pays off, I had to use brute force to solve the problem initially in order to understand it and then create a solution. Although it was difficult, building step by step helped me arrive at the solution.
